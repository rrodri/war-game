Intro:
--
Hi Aspen Capital Dev team. Enclosed you will find my War Game implementation. I've had a busy work week and will also
 have a busy weekend coming up, so I was only able to dedicate ~9 hours to this project over two days. I will therefore
 use this document to explain my implementation.


Testing:
--
 - I usually implement using TDD at work. Given the time constraint, I did not use TDD for the purposes of this project.
 TDD would have significantly increased the amount and code in this submission. I have included some simple tests for
 the purpose of exhibiting testing.
 
How To Run:
--
For your convenience I have the project ready for your review at https://repl.it/@rrodri/war-game. The git repo is also
located at https://github.com/rrodri/war-game.

maven command: mvn package && java -jar target/war-1.0.jar.
